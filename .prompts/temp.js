 * Performs the minimax algorithm to choose the best move: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax (pseudocode provided)
 * Recursively explores all possible moves up to a given depth, and evaluates the game board at the leaves.
 *
 * Basic idea: maximize the minimum value of the position resulting from the opponent's possible following moves.
 * Optimization: alpha-beta pruning: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning (pseudocode provided)
 *
 * Inputs:
 *  - game:                 the game object.
 *  - depth:                the depth of the recursive tree of all possible moves (i.e. height limit).
 *  - isMaximizingPlayer:   true if the current layer is maximizing, false otherwise.
 *  - sum:                  the sum (evaluation) so far at the current layer.
 *  - color:                the color of the current player.
 *
 * Output:
 *  the best move at the root of the current subtree.
