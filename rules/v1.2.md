## **\[v1.2\] Extended Terrain**

*Version 1.2 introduces the larger R=8 map option and rules for random terrain generation.*

### **1\. Overview**

Hex Dice is a tactical board game where players command armies of dice, using their face values to determine their unit type, abilities, and movement. Played on a hexagonal map, players maneuver their forces, engage in deterministic combat, and aim to defeat all opponents or capture their base. Version 1.2 adds rules for playing on a larger R=8 map with variable terrain.

### **2\. Components**

* 1 Hexagonal Map (Either R=6 or R=8 size)  
  * R=6 map: As described in v1.0, with two marked Base cells.  
  * R=8 map: A larger hexagonal map extending 8 hexes in any straight direction from the center to the edge. It should have 6 designated "corner" hexes for multiplayer bases and potentially marked neutral terrain cells or zones for terrain placement.  
* Standard 6-sided dice: Multiple sets of distinct colors, one color per player, *plus* additional dice specifically for terrain generation.  
  * For 2 Players (R=6 map): 6 Red Dice, 6 Blue Dice.  
  * For 3 Players (R=6 or R=8 map): 3 sets of 4 dice each.  
  * For 4 Players (R=6 or R=8 map): 4 sets of 3 dice each.  
  * For 6 Players (R=6 or R=8 map): 6 sets of 3 dice each.  
  * For Terrain Generation (R=8 map only): 6 standard D6 dice.  
* Terrain Layout Presets (Either R=6 or R=8 size)

### **3\. Setup Terrain**

Each map could have some variations of preset terrain layout to choose from. Each game could be chosen from Terrain Preset, Terrain Roulette or Terrain Generation method to set up terrain. 

1. **Terrain Preset Map:** If multiple pre-designed terrain layouts are available, players agree on a method to randomly select one layout from the available options (e.g., roll a dice  against a numbered list of layouts, draw a card). Place terrain layout onto the map according to the selected layout.  
2. **Terrain Roulette:**  
   * **Step a: Determine the Number of Terrain Cells:**  
     * Roll all 6 terrain D6 dice.  
     * Sum the results of these 6 dice. This sum is the total number of terrain hexes that will be placed on the map. (Minimum 6, Maximum 36).  
   * **Step b: Determine the Location of Each Terrain Cell:**  
     * The location phase begins in roulette (clockwise), each player places one terrain cell in their wish on valid hex, then passes to the next player’s placing.  
     * The valid terrain hex location is not the R=0 center hex, is not one of the 6 Base corner hexes, and does not already contain a terrain hex.  
         
3. **Terrain Generation (R=8 Map Only):** If using the R=8 map, terrain could be added randomly *before* deployment. Follow these three steps using the extra set of 6 dice:  
     
   * **Step a: Determine the Number of Terrain Cells:**  
     * Roll all 6 terrain D6 dice.  
     * Sum the results of these 6 dice. This sum is the total number of terrain hexes that will be placed on the map. (Minimum 6, Maximum 36).

     

   * **Step b: Determine the Location of Each Terrain Cell:**  
       
     * **For each** terrain hex determined in Step 3a, roll **4 standard D6** dice consecutively to determine it.  
       * **Roll 1 (Direction)**: Result 1-6. This selects one of the 6 main radial directions emanating from the center of the map (arbitrarily assign 1 to 6 to these directions).  
       * **Roll 2 (Distance)**: Result 1-6. Map this result to a distance from the center: 1-\>3 steps, 2-\>4 steps, 3-\>5 steps, 4-\>6 steps, 5-\>7 steps, 6-\>8 steps. The hex located this many steps from the map center along the chosen Direction is the Anchor Hex.  
       * **Roll 3 (Scatter)**: Result 1-6. This selects one of the 6 directions around the Anchor Hex (assign 1 to 6 to adjacent directions). Move 1 step from the Anchor Hex in the Scatter direction. This is the potential location for the terrain hex.  
       * **Roll 4 (Terrain)**: Result 1-6. This selects the terrain type for the target hex: 1 or 2 \-\> Forest, 3 or 4 \-\> Lake, 5 \-\> Tower, 6 \-\> Mountain.  
     * **Placement Check**: The potential terrain hex location is only valid if it is not the R=0 center hex, is not one of the 6 Base corner hexes, and does not already contain a terrain hex.  
       * If the location is valid, place a marker for the terrain hex there.  
       * If the location is invalid (R=0, Base, or already occupied by terrain), ignore this specific result. Do NOT re-roll for a new location; this potential terrain hex is simply not placed.   
     * Proceed to roll for the next terrain hex determined in **Step a**

   

After finishing the Terrain Setup, each player rolls one standard D6 dice. The player with the highest roll chooses their starting corner hex first. The player with the next highest roll chooses second, and so on, in descending order of their roll. (In case of ties, tied players reroll their dice until the tie is broken).

### **4\. Terrain Rules (R=8 Map Only)**

Terrain hexes are placed on the map during setup for R=8 games. A hex can only contain one terrain type. Units may move onto and occupy terrain hexes unless the terrain type explicitly makes the hex impassable. Units on terrain may gain benefits or suffer penalties as described below.

* **Forest:**  
  * **Movement:**   
    * Costs 1 movement step to enter or exit a Forest hex (normal).  
  * **Combat:**   
    * A unit defending while on a Forest hex gains **\+1 to its Armor** value against all attacks (melee or ranged).   
    * Forest hexes block line of sight for Ranged Attacks (Dice 5).  
* **Lake:**  
  * **Movement:**   
    * Lake hexes are **impassable**.   
    * Units cannot enter or move through Lake hexes.  
  * **Combat:**   
    * Units cannot occupy Lake hexes, so they cannot participate in combat from or on them.   
    * Lake hexes do not block line of sight for Ranged Attacks.  
* **Tower:**  
  * **Movement:**   
    * Costs 1 movement step to enter or exit a Tower hex (normal).  
  * **Combat:**   
    * A unit defending while on a Tower hex gains **\+1 to its Armor** value against all attacks.   
    * This bonus stacks with the Armor bonus gained from the Guard action.   
    * Tower hexes block line of sight for Ranged Attacks.  
    * A Dice 5 unit performing a Ranged Attack *from* a Tower hex can target enemy units located **1 (added melee), 2, or 3 hexes away** in a straight line.  
* **Mountain:**  
  * **Movement:**   
    * Costs 2 movement steps to enter or exit a Mountain hex. Dice 1, Dice 2 & Dice 4 are reduced maximum movement distance by 1\. Dice 5 is not affected by this cost. Dice 6 is still able to move on Mountain hex by winning a combat.  
    * Mountain hexes are impassable to Dice 3 units due to their movement style restriction.   
    * Mountain hexes block line of sight for Ranged Attacks (Dice 5).  
  * **Combat:**   
    * A unit defending while on a Mountain hex gains **\+2 to its Armor** value against all attacks.   
    * This bonus stacks with the Armor bonus gained from the Guard action.  
    * A Dice 5 unit performing a Ranged Attack *from* a Mountain hex can target enemy units located **2, 3, or 4 (extra range) hexes away** in a straight line. It still cannot target units 1 hex away.

### **5\. Gameplay**

Gameplay proceeds as described in Version 1.0. Players activate their units (Move, Reroll, or Ranged Attack for Dice 5). Movement rules are modified by terrain movement costs. Combat rules are modified by terrain defensive bonuses and Dice 5 range modifications from specific terrain types.

### **6\. Map Description**

The R=8 map is a larger hexagonal grid with 6 corner hexes serving as player Bases. Terrain hexes are placed randomly during setup according to the terrain generation rules, affecting movement and combat for units occupying or interacting with them. The R=0 center hex and the 6 Base corner hexes can never contain terrain.
