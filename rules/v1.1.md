# **Hex Dice**

## *Tactical hexagon board game where players command armies of dice, using their values to determine their abilities.*

#### **\[v1.1\] Merging**

* Merging counts as the moving unit's action for the turn.  
* A unit performing a **Move** action (called **Merg Unit**) must move to a hex currently occupied by a single friendly unit (called **Target Unit**). This action is called Merging.  
* **Resulting Unit:**  
  * Sum the face values of the two friendly units (the moving unit \+ the occupying unit).  
    * If the sum is **6 or less**, the two units merge into a single new unit with a face value equal to the sum. This new unit is placed on the hex. The new unit formed by the merging cannot perform any further actions this turn.  
    * If the sum is **greater than 6** (e.g., 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), the merging units create a more potent force. The player chooses *any* desired face value from **Dice 1 through Dice 6** (Dice 1, Dice 2, Dice 3, Dice 4, Dice 5 or Dice 6\) for the single new unit. This new unit is placed on the hex. **And if the Target Unit did not act last turn**, the new unit may immediately perform one action (Move, Guard, or Ranged/Special Attack).   
  * The new unit (whether based on sum \<= 6 or chosen from 1-6) uses the stats (Attack, Armor, Range, Distance, Movement) corresponding to its new face value from the Dice Soldiers table.  
  * Both original units are removed from the board immediately upon merging, replaced by a single new unit.  
* Merging counts as the moving unit's action for the turn that initiates the merge.

### **6\. Combat**

Combat occurs when:

1. A unit uses a Move action to enter an enemy-occupied hex (Melee Combat).  
2. A Dice 5 unit uses a Ranged Attack action on an enemy unit at range (Ranged Combat).  
3. A Dice 6 unit uses a Special Attack action on an enemy unit at range.

Combat is deterministic:

- A unit's Effective Armor value used in combat is its base Armor value (from the Dice Soldiers table) minus the total value of any Armor Reduction tokens currently on it. A unit's Effective Armor cannot go below 0 for combat comparison.  
- Compare the **Attacking** unit's **Attack** value to the **Defending** unit's **Armor** value.  
- If the Attacking unit's **Attack is greater than or equal to** the Defending unit's **Armor** (Attacker.Attack ≥ Defender.Armor), the attack is successful. The Defending unit is defeated and removed from the board.  
  - In Melee Combat, the Attacking unit then moves into the hex vacated by the defeated unit.  
  - In Ranged Combat, the Attacking Dice 5 unit remains in its original hex.  
  - In Special Combat, the Attacking Dice 6 unit moves to its target hex.  
- If the Attacking unit's **Attack is less than** the Defending unit's **Armor** (Attacker.Attack \< Defender.Armor), the attack fails. The Defending unit remains on its hex but with armor reduction effect (Armor \- 1).  
  - Armor reductions from failed attacks stack cumulatively.  
  - The minimum trackable Armor value is 0\.  
  - If a unit's Armor reaches 0, the next attack it suffers, regardless of the attacker's Attack value, automatically defeats it.  
  - Armor reduction is indicated using Armor Reduction Token (could be another mini red dice) from a value range **from \[-1\] to \[-6\]**.

### **7\. Winning the Game**

The conditions for winning depend on the number of players:

- **2 Players:** A player wins immediately if either of the following conditions is met during their turn:  
  1. **Annihilation:** All enemy units are removed from the board.  
  2. **Base Capture:** One of your units successfully moves onto the opponent's Base cell. If the Base cell was occupied by an enemy unit, your unit must win the combat to occupy the cell and win.  
- **3, 4, or 6 Players:** The game ends immediately when only one player has units remaining on the board. That player is the winner.  
  - A player is **eliminated** from the game if either of the following conditions is met during *any* player's turn:  
    1. All their units are removed from the board.  
    2. An opponent's unit successfully moves onto and occupies their Base corner hex. If the Base hex was occupied by one of the eliminated player's units, combat occurs first, and the attacking unit must win to occupy the hex and eliminate the player.  
  - Play continues among the remaining players until only one player is left.

### **8\. Map Description**

The map is an R=6 hexagonal grid, meaning it extends 6 hexes in any straight direction from the center to the edge. Movement is measured in steps between adjacent hexes. Specific hexes are marked as Base locations for 2-player games, and the corner hexes serve as Base locations for multiplayer games.
