## *Tactical hexagon board game where players command armies of dice, using their values to determine their abilities.*

## **\[v1.4\] Terraform Ability**

### **Dice 6 (Legion/Division)**

* **Armor:** 6  
* **Attack:** 6  
* **Range:** 0 (No Ranged Attack)  
* **Movement:** 0 (Cannot move *normally*)  
* **Notes:** Special Combat Mobility; Terraform Ability; Adjacent units gain \+1 Armor.

On a player's turn, when a Dice 6 unit is activated, it can perform **one** of the following actions:

1. #### **Special Attack (Melee Attack with Conditional Movement as v1.0)**

     
   * **Action:** The Dice 6 unit targets a single enemy unit located exactly **1 hex away** (adjacent) along any of the 6 radial axes.  
   * **Combat:** Combat occurs as normal (see Section 6: Combat).  
   * **Conditional Movement:** If the Dice 6 unit **wins** the combat (Attacker.Attack ≥ Defender.Armor), the defending unit is removed, and the Dice 6 unit **immediately moves into the vacated hex**.  
   * **Failure:** If the Dice 6 unit fails the combat (Attacker.Attack \< Defender.Armor), the defending unit remains on its hex with armor reduction, and the Dice 6 unit remains in its original hex.  
   * **Note:** This action allows the Dice 6 to advance only by actively defeating an adjacent enemy.

   

2. #### **Terraform**

     
* **Action:** The Dice 6 unit initiates a terrain alteration on an adjacent hex.  
* **Target:** An adjacent hex (1 step away) that contains **no unit**. It cannot target a Base hex.  
* **Effect (Initiation):**  
  * The player declares which operation they are performing:  
    * **If the target hex is a Clear hex:** It will become a **Forest** hex.  
    * **If the target hex is a Forest, Lake, or Tower hex:** It will become a **Clear** hex.  
  * Place an **"Under Construction" token** (or marker) on the target hex.  
  * The target hex retains its **current terrain properties** for the remainder of this turn and the opponent's turn.  
* **Completion (After one full round):**  
  * At the **start of Player A's *next* turn** (the turn immediately following the opponent's turn), the "Under Construction" token is removed.  
  * The terrain of the hex **permanently changes** to the new type (Forest or Clear) as declared during the initiation phase.  
  * The Dice 6 unit is **fully active** on this turn and can take any action.  
* **Restriction:** The Dice 6 unit **cannot change Mountain hexes** with this ability.
